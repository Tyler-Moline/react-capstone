        Well, this is a little difficult for me, because I don't always feel
        like my ability to articulate my thoughts is not great, but I will do my
        best.{" "}

        Struggles I faced in my capstone was the cart page. The ability for me
        to be able to track what products appear, what the quantity of that
        product is being able to change that quantity from the cart page itself.
        it required alot of passing props and changing state back and forth on
        those pages. It took my brain a bit to wrap around it, but luckily I
        felt my solution worked well! Also the sort and and search functions for
        the product page were a little trying for me. Being able to to rerender
        the search options put my mind to the test.

        Through the FE class I struggled with javascript a little bit. The fact
        that it kind of does things in whatever order it wants was difficult for
        me to understand at times. Coming from Python that is very systematic
        and only goes in one direction to JS that will do whatever it wants when
        it wants was tough. but luckily I feel like through testing and practice
        I was able to master it enough to get it to do what I needed
      </p>
      <p>
        But now to branch off of that, I feel like I like JS the most! It has
        the ability and flexibilty to do whatever you need. You have alot of
        power at your finger tips with it!
